### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abe Han<br/>
I am a 24 years old, self-taught, beginner front-end developer from Korea.<br/>
Programming is my main hobby which I have been progressively developing for months.<br/>
So far I have no professional experience in programming, however I am looking forward to good collaboration in the future!<br/>
