### 👋 Hi, I'm Abe

I'm a full stack developer based in South Korea 🇰🇷  
I specialize in building clean, scalable, and intuitive web apps using **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Serverless architecture**.  
I love crafting products that are fast, thoughtful, and actually used by real people.
